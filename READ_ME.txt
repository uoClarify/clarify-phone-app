Process to make an expo app:

npm install -g expo-cli

- It will prompt you with choices, I choose typscript

cd MyExpoApp

expo start

-install windows or what ever functionality


Notes:

Lets make it as structured as possible
We could have all primary pages in the Pages folder. 
Each page can have its own folder for components, within the components folder.
